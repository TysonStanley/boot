Bootstrap S-Plus Functions  (Version 1.2; March 2001)
===========================================================

This version corrects some minor errors in Version 1.0 of the code
distributed with the first printing of Davison and Hinkley (1997).
The author would like to thank those users who pointed out errors or
possible improvements to the code.  Any further errors found should be
reported to the author at the address below for correction in the
next version.

The library contains the following functions, all of which
have online help available.

abc.ci		ABC confidence intervals
boot		Main bootstrap function
boot.array	Generate a bootstrap frequency/index array
boot.ci		Bootstrap simulation confidence intervals
censboot	Bootstrap for censored data and Cox regression models.
control		Control variate calculations
corr		Weighted form of correlation coefficient
cum3		Estimate the skewness
cv.glm		Cross-validation for generalized linear models
empinf		Calculate empirical influence values
envelope	Confidence envelopes for functions
exp.tilt	Exponential tilting
freq.array	Convert an index array into a frequency array
glm.diag	Diagnostics for generalized linear models
glm.diag.plots	Diagnostic plots for glm's
imp.moments	Importance resampling estimates of moments
imp.prob	Importance resampling estimates of probabilities
imp.quantile	Importance resampling estimates of quantiles
imp.weights	Weights for importance resampling
inv.logit	Inverse logit function
jack.after.boot	Jackknife after bootstrap plots
k3.linear	Linear skewness approximation

lines.saddle.distn  Lines method for a saddlepoint distribution object
logit		Logit of a proportion
norm.ci		Normal approximation confidence intervals
plot.boot	Plot method for a bootstrap object
print.boot	Print method for a bootstrap object
print.bootci	Print method for a bootstrap confidence interval object
print.saddle.distn  Print method for a saddlepoint distribution object
print.simplex	Print method for a simplex object
saddle		Simple and conditional saddlepoint calculations
saddle.distn	Approximate a distribution by saddlepoint
simplex		Tableau simplex method for linear programming
smooth.f	Frequency smoothing
tilt.boot	Tilted bootstrap
tsboot		Bootstrap for time series
var.linear	Linear variance approximation

As well as these functions the following functions are included.
These functions are not intended to be used alone but are used by the
above functions.

antithetic.array	anti.arr		balanced.array
basic.ci		bca.ci			boot.return
cens.case		cens.resamp		cens.return		
cens.weird		const			empinf.reg
extra.array		iden			importance.array	
importance.array.bal	imp.reg			index.array
inf.jack		make.ends		norm.inter
normalize		ordinary.array		perc.ci
permutation.array	positive.jack		scramble
simplex1		stud.ci			ts.array		
ts.return		usual.jack		zero			


The library contains the following dataframes

acme		aids		aircondit	aircondit7	amis
aml		beaver		bigcity		birthwt		brambles
breslow		calcium		cane		capability	cats
catsM		cav		cd4		cement		channing
city		claridge	cloth		coal		co.transfer
darwin		downs.bc	ducks		fir		frets
gravity		grav		hirose		islay		leuk
mammals		manaus		mcycle		melanoma	motor
neuro		nitrofen	nodal		nuclear		paulsen
phones		poisons		polar		remission	rock
salinity	survival	tau		tuna		urine
wool

Two regular time series of class "ts" in boot under S are under package `ts'
in the base R distribution:
lynx		sunspot
(The beaver dataframe is also of class "ts")

Each of these data sets has an associated help file giving brief details
of the data and its source.

In addition there are help files for the four classes of objects that are
used in this library.  Those objects are

boot.object	bootci.object	saddle.distn.object	simplex.object

The library also contains some items used in the practicals of
"Bootstrap Methods and Their Applications" by A.C. Davison and D.V. Hinkley
(1997, Cambridge University Press).  The objects are not intended to be used
except in the context of these practicals.  The objects are

cd4.nested	A nested bootstrap referred to in Practical 5.5
corr.nested	The statistic used in cd4.nested
EL.profile, EEF.profile, and lik.CI 
	functions defined for use in the practicals of chapter 10.
